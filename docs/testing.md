# Testing & coverage

Two layers, both Catch2:

- **`tests/unit/`** — fast, isolated, one behaviour each. Currently exercises
  `cube::error` (`Result<T>`/`CubeError`), `cube::version`, and
  `ScanSessionConfig`'s fluent builder.
- **`tests/integration/`** — exercises several components together; the
  current test drives the CMake-selected platform implementations
  (`cube::platform::paths`, `cube::platform::inference_env`,
  `cube::platform::camera`) end to end rather than any single interface in
  isolation.

Run them with `ctest --preset <preset>` after building.

## Debug is slow - use `fastdebug` for local iteration

A plain `Debug` build (`windows-msvc-debug`/`linux-gcc-debug`/`macos-clang-debug`)
compiles unoptimized *and* enables ASan/UBSan (see
[Sanitizers.cmake](../cmake/Sanitizers.cmake)). The solver's search
(`cube::solver::detail::commutator_search` et al., see
[bfs_search.hpp](../src/lib/src/solver/bfs_search.hpp)) does enough
`std::vector`/`std::unordered_set` churn per node that an unoptimized build
alone - independent of the sanitizers - is well over an order of magnitude
slower there than Release; a handful of `solve_pll`/`solve_oll` corpus
scrambles can turn a sub-minute Release run into 20+ minutes in Debug.

For local dev/test iteration, prefer the `fastdebug` preset
(`windows-msvc-fastdebug`/`linux-gcc-fastdebug`/`macos-clang-fastdebug`):
optimizations on (`RelWithDebInfo`), sanitizers and iterator-debug checks off
(both are gated on `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` specifically), debug info still
present for breakpoints/stepping. Reach for a true `*-debug` preset only when
you actually want ASan/UBSan coverage.

## Slow tests

The solver's corpus tests (`solve_cross`, `solve_corners`,
`solve_middle_edges`, `solve_oll`, `solve_pll`, and `solve`'s own corpus
case) are tagged `[slow]` - they each search many random scrambles, and
`solve_pll` in particular can occasionally take tens of minutes to search a
single hard scramble (see its test's own comment). Skip them for a fast
local loop, or run only them:

```
ctest --preset <preset> -LE slow   # everything except the slow solver corpus tests
ctest --preset <preset> -L slow    # just the slow solver corpus tests
```

## Coverage gate

CI's `Coverage (Linux, GCC)` job builds the `linux-gcc-coverage` preset
(`CUBEULATOR_ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON`, `CUBEULATOR_BUILD_APP=OFF`) and runs:

```
gcovr --root . --filter 'src/.*' \
  --fail-under-line 80 --fail-under-branch 80
```

New behaviour should come with a test in the same PR (TDD by convention);
`src/lib/` in particular has no platform/GUI dependency to complicate
mocking, so it should clear meaningfully more than the 80% floor.
